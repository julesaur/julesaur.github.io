Y/N
<br />
<br />
There are two things that I haven’t experience which are happiness and love.
<br />
<br />
I don’t think I can achieve those.
<br />
<br />
My standards of happiness is way too high and I want to live a short life.
<br />
<br />
However, I hope I can find things that would make me want to live longer.
<br />
<br />
An opportunity to go to space.
<br /> 
<br />
It feels so surreal.
<br />
<br />
It’s nice to could go somewhere far away.
<br />
<br />
I barely existed in the adult world with bare minimum of contact with friends and family.
<br />
<br />
It’s only a month in space what could’ve happened? </font>
